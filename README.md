# Java_Final
Final Project for Java Cohort Class

## What I did
For my final project, I have made a simple Rock-Paper-Scissors type of game. For this project, I have made sure to use a GUI and objects. It being a very simple game, I have been able to keep everything contained in one file.
 
 ## Why Do This?
 While doing research for what I should do for my project, I have figured out that there are not very many examples of any simple Rock-Paper-Scissors games, specifically in the Java coding language. I've also just thought that Rock-Paper-Scissors games are kind of a type of classic games.
 ## Anything else?
 Not much, I'm just going to go a little in depth about what I did to create this project.
 
 ## Making This Project
 Using Java was somewhat difficule for making this particular project, but not impossible, so I set out to first make a GUI. For this, I used Frames, JFrames, and JLabels for the buttons.
  
		frame.setLayout(new FlowLayout());
		frame.add(user);
		frame.add(rock);
		frame.add(paper);
		frame.add(scissors);
		frame.add(comp);
		frame.add(round);
		frame.add(score);
		frame.setVisible(true);

## That's about it!
If you've read this far, thanks! I appreciate it. This is my school project, so I had a lot of work go into it.
